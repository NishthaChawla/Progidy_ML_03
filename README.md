## SVM Model for Image Classification: Cats vs. Dogs 

I recently worked on implementing and evaluating an SVM model for classifying images of cats and dogs. The project aimed to build a reliable classification pipeline by leveraging effective preprocessing, feature extraction, and evaluation techniques.

## Key Insights:
- Class Performance: The model demonstrated differences in precision and recall between the two classes, highlighting its ability to distinguish images but with room for refinement.
- Preprocessing Impact: Normalization, resizing, and standardization were crucial in preparing the image data for SVM, emphasizing the importance of proper preprocessing.
- Feature Extraction Challenges: Flattening image data revealed potential limitations in capturing complex visual features, suggesting the need for more advanced methods.

## Analysis Techniques:
- Preprocessed images using techniques like resizing, normalization, and flattening to ensure consistency across inputs.
- Applied StandardScaler for feature standardization to optimize SVM performance.
- Evaluated the model with precision, recall, and F1-score to identify strengths and weaknesses.
